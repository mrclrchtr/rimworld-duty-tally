[h1]DutyTally[/h1]
Keep your colony running smoothly with DutyTally!

This lightweight mod adds a "Workload" column to the Work tab, showing a score based on the work types assigned to each colonist. This helps you balance work assignments across your colony and quickly identify colonists who may be overworked or underutilized.

[h2]FAQ:[/h2]
[list]
    [*] [b]Q: How is the workload score calculated?[/b]
    [b]A:[/b] By default, it uses a weighted sum based on task priority, using the formula `Max(1, MaxPrioritySetting - Priority)`. You can configure the MaxPrioritySetting in Mod Settings (default is 4, giving weights P1=3, P2=2, P3=1, P4=1). You can switch to a simple count of assigned tasks or adjust the weighting range in the Mod Settings.

    [*] [b]Q: Why is the workload score not what I expect / incorrect?[/b]
    [b]A:[/b] By default, the mod counts all work types, including those not normally visible (like 'Finish Off' from 'Allow Tool'). You can change this in Mod Settings by enabling the "Ignore invisible work types" option. Also, check if you are using weighted scoring or simple count mode.

    [*] [b]Q: Can I add this to an existing save?[/b]
    [b]A:[/b] Yes, it's safe to add or remove from existing saves as it primarily modifies the UI.
