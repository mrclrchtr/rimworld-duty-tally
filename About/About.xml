Keep your colony running smoothly with Duty Tally!

This lightweight mod adds a "Workload" column to the Work tab, showing exactly how many work types each colonist is assigned.
Instantly see who’s overworked or underutilized and manage your pawns’ workload with precision.

Features:
✅ Workload Column: See assigned job counts at a glance in the Work tab.
✅ Sortable: Click the column header to easily organize colonists by workload.
✅ Configurable: Option to ignore invisible work types (like those added by other mods).
✅ Vanilla-Friendly: Integrates seamlessly with the standard RimWorld UI.

"The Overseer’s best friend since 5500."
