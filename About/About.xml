Keep your colony running smoothly with Duty Tally!

This lightweight mod adds a Job Count column to the Work tab, showing exactly how many work types each colonist is assigned.
No more guessing who’s overworked or underutilized — manage your pawns’ workload with precision.

Features:
✅ Instant Overview: See assigned job counts at a glance.
✅ Sortable Column: Organize colonists by workload (or laziness!).
✅ Vanilla-Friendly: Seamlessly integrates with RimWorld’s UI.
✅ Zero Performance Impact: Runs efficiently, even in massive colonies.

"The Overseer’s best friend since 5500."
